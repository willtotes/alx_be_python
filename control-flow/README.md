# Python Control Flow & Loops Project

This project is part of my journey learning Python through the ALX Backend Engineering track. In this one, I focused on control flow, decision-making, and loops — the core tools for building logic into programs and automating repetitive tasks.

## What I Learned

### Control Flow (if / elif / else)

- I now understand how control flow helps a program decide what to do based on different conditions.
- I used `if`, `elif`, and `else` to write programs that behave differently depending on input or values.
- I practiced writing multiple conditional branches to handle real-world scenarios like weather advice and calculators.

### Match Case (Python 3.10+)

- I explored `match case` as a cleaner alternative to multiple `elif` blocks (available in Python 3.10 and above).
- I learned how to match specific values and types using this structure.
- I saw how it improves code readability when dealing with many conditions.
- Even though it's optional, I included it in one of my calculator files.

### Loops

#### For Loops:

- I used `for` loops to go through lists, strings, and other sequences.
- I created examples where I printed items, calculated totals, and looped through characters.

#### While Loops:

- I learned how `while` loops work when I want something to run **as long as a condition stays true**.
- I used it to build interactive loops and simulate processes that run until a stop condition is met.

#### Nested Loops:

- I practiced putting one loop inside another — great for creating patterns and working with multi-dimensional data like grids.

## Example Files

- `weather_advice.py` — basic `if/elif/else` logic
- `match_case_calculator.py` — using match/case for a simple calculator
- `pattern_drawing.py` — used nested loops to draw patterns
- `multiplication_table.py` — used loops to generate print of multiplication table
- `daily_reminder.py` — used conditional statements, Match Case, and loops

## Why This Project Matters

This project helped me understand the “thinking” part of a program — how it makes decisions, reacts to inputs, and repeats steps automatically. These concepts are key for building real-world applications and writing more powerful, flexible code.

## Tools I Used

- Python 3.13+
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
