# Python Introduction Project

This is my first step into learning Python as part of the ALX Backend Engineering track. This project helped me understand what Python is, how to set it up, and how to start writing simple code with it.

---

## What I Learned

### What is Python?

- I learned that Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **easy-to-read** programming language.
- It's widely used in different fields like:
  - Web development
  - Data analysis
  - Machine learning
  - Automation and scripting
- Python is known for its **clean syntax** and being beginner-friendly.

---

### Setting Up Python

- I installed Python on my system.
- I set up my development environment using **VS Code**.
- I ran my first Python scripts from both the terminal and the code editor.

---

### Importance of Indentation

- One thing I discovered early is that **indentation is not optional in Python**.
- Writing properly indented code makes Python programs **more readable** and **less error-prone**.

---

### ‚úçüèΩ Writing Basic Python Code

- I practiced writing simple Python programs using:
  - `print()` to display messages
  - Variables to store values
  - Arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- I followed basic syntax rules like using colons (`:`) and correct indentation.

## Why This Project Matters

This project laid the foundation for everything else I‚Äôll be learning in Python. Now that I understand what Python is and how to set it up, I feel more confident moving on to more complex topics like loops, functions, and data structures.

## Example Files

- `basic_operations` - performs simple arithmetic.
- `simple_interest.py` - uses the `I = P * R * T` formula to calculate interest on a fixed amount. 
- `rectangle_area.py` - calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying length and width. 
- `hours_to_seconds.py` - converts a given number of hours to seconds.
- `future_age_calculator.py` - asks user for their age and calculates how old they'll be in 2050.
- `finance_calculator.py` - asks the user to input income and expenses, then calculates their monthly savings and projected annual savings incl 5% interest.

## Tools I Used

- Python 3.10+
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub
